# Faster R-CNN in MXNet

![example detections](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13162287/22101032/92085dc0-de6c-11e6-9228-67e72606ddbc.png)

Region Proposal Network solves object detection as a regression problem 
from the objectness perspective. Bounding boxes are predicted by applying 
learned bounding box deltas to base boxes, namely anchor boxes across 
different positions in feature maps. Training process directly learns a 
mapping from raw image intensities to bounding box transformation targets.

Fast R-CNN treats general object detection as a classification problem and
bounding box prediction as a regression problem. Classifying cropped region
feature maps and predicting bounding box displacements together yields
detection results. Cropping feature maps instead of image input accelerates
computation utilizing shared convolution maps. Bounding box displacements
are simultaneously learned in the training process.

Faster R-CNN utilize an alternate optimization training process between RPN 
and Fast R-CNN. Fast R-CNN weights are used to initiate RPN for training.
The approximate joint training scheme does not backpropagate rcnn training
error to rpn training.

| Valset performance [2] | mAP 73.2               | mAP 75.97                   |
| Memory usage [3]  | 11G for Fast R-CNN     | 4.6G for Fast R-CNN         |
| Parallelization  [4] | None              | 3.8 img/s to 6 img/s for 2 GPUs |
| Extensibility [5] | Old framework and base networks | ResNet           |

[1] On Ubuntu 14.04.5 with device Titan X, cuDNN enabled.
    The experiment is VGG-16 end-to-end training.  
[2] VGG network. Trained end-to-end on VOC07trainval+12trainval, tested on VOC07 test.  
[3] VGG network. Fast R-CNN is the most memory expensive process.  
[4] VGG network (parallelization limited by bandwidth).
    ResNet-101 speeds up from 2 img/s to 3.5 img/s.  
[5] py-faster-rcnn does not support ResNet or recent caffe version.
